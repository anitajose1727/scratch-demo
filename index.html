        <p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science,
            music,
            sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.

            The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone
            realizes
            why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.
            To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.</p>

    <div class="two">
        <p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of
            the
            individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the European languages.

            It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like
            simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European
            languages
            are members of the same family.Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe
            uses
